## Key User Scenarios

### Morning Mood Boost
User wakes up feeling sluggish and opens MoodMatch. The app detects their low-energy state through voice and typing patterns. It suggests an "Energy Boost" playlist that starts with calm tracks and gradually increases in tempo and energy. After 20 minutes, it checks in to see if their mood has improved.

### Workday Stress Management
During a stressful workday, the app notices rapid typing and tense voice patterns. It sends a gentle notification suggesting a 5-minute "Calm Break" with appropriate music. The interface shifts to soothing colors and simplified controls to reduce cognitive load.

### Social Mood Sharing
User is feeling particularly happy and wants to share this mood. They can generate a "Happiness Playlist" and share it with friends through social platforms, with optional mood context. Friends can "join" the mood by playing the same playlist.

### Emotional Health Insight
After using the app for several weeks, the user receives an insight that their mood tends to dip on Thursdays but improves with specific music genres. If health integration is enabled, it might also show correlations with sleep patterns or activity levels.
