# MoodMatch App Architecture

## Overview

MoodMatch is a mobile application that detects user mood using various sensors and data points, then creates personalized music recommendations to match or enhance that mood. The app also integrates with health platforms to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the user's emotional and physical state.

## Core Components

### 1. Mood Detection System

The mood detection system uses multiple inputs to determine the user's current emotional state:

#### Input Sources:
- **Voice Analysis**: Analyzes tone, pitch, and speech patterns to detect emotions
- **Typing Patterns**: Monitors typing speed, pressure, and error rates
- **Facial Expression**: Uses camera (with permission) to analyze facial expressions
- **Motion Sensors**: Leverages accelerometer and gyroscope data to detect movement patterns
- **Health App Data**: Integrates with health platforms for additional context (sleep quality, activity levels)
- **Manual Input**: Allows users to manually log their mood

#### Processing Layer:
- **Multi-modal Fusion**: Combines data from multiple sources for more accurate mood detection
- **Contextual Analysis**: Considers time of day, location, and recent activities
- **Machine Learning Models**: Processes raw sensor data to classify emotional states
- **Confidence Scoring**: Assigns confidence levels to detected moods based on available data

#### Output:
- **Primary Mood**: Main emotional state (happy, sad, energetic, calm, stressed, etc.)
- **Mood Intensity**: Strength of the detected emotion (1-10 scale)
- **Secondary Moods**: Additional emotional nuances detected
- **Confidence Score**: Reliability rating of the mood detection

### 2. Music Recommendation Engine

The music recommendation engine uses the detected mood to create personalized playlists:

#### Input Sources:
- **Detected Mood**: Primary and secondary moods from the detection system
- **User Preferences**: Favorite genres, artists, and previously liked recommendations
- **Listening History**: Patterns in music consumption
- **Music API Data**: Audio features and mood classifications from streaming services

#### Processing Layer:
- **Mood-Music Mapping**: Correlates emotional states with musical attributes
- **Personalization Algorithm**: Adapts recommendations based on user preferences
- **Diversity Control**: Ensures variety while maintaining mood relevance
- **Novelty Factor**: Introduces new music that matches the mood profile

#### Output:
- **Curated Playlist**: Collection of songs matching the detected mood
- **Mood Transition Options**: Alternative playlists for shifting to different moods
- **Individual Song Recommendations**: Specific tracks with high mood-match scores
- **Explanation**: Brief rationale for why each song was selected

### 3. Health Platform Integration

The health platform integration provides additional context and stores mood-related health data:

#### Input Sources:
- **Apple HealthKit**: State of Mind data and other health metrics (iOS)
- **Samsung Health**: Stress measurements and health data (Android/Samsung)
- **Health Connect**: Standardized health data access (Android)

#### Processing Layer:
- **Data Normalization**: Converts health data from different sources into a standard format
- **Correlation Analysis**: Identifies relationships between health metrics and mood
- **Trend Detection**: Recognizes patterns in mood and health data over time
- **Privacy Filter**: Ensures only relevant data is accessed and stored

#### Output:
- **Health Insights**: Correlations between mood and physical health
- **Mood Journaling**: Records mood data to health platforms (with permission)
- **Wellness Suggestions**: Recommendations based on mood and health data
- **Progress Tracking**: Visualization of mood trends over time

### 4. User Interface & Experience

The user interface provides an intuitive and engaging experience:

#### Key Screens:
- **Home/Dashboard**: Current mood display and quick access to recommendations
- **Mood Detection**: Interface for active mood detection and manual input
- **Music Player**: Integrated player for recommended music
- **Insights**: Visualizations of mood patterns and correlations
- **Settings**: Customization options and integration controls

#### User Flows:
- **Onboarding**: Permission requests, preference setup, and integration configuration
- **Daily Use**: Passive mood detection, music recommendations, and playback
- **Active Mood Boosting**: Intentional mood shifting through music
- **Review & Reflect**: Exploring mood patterns and health correlations
